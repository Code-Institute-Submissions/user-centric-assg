# User Centric Project
This is my assignment for User Centric module. I am building a frontend-only website for a band called The Monkees. 

# UI/UX
1. Strategy: The primary target audience is the fans of the monkees who want to view the site for their upcoming tours.The goal of the website is to promote their tours and showcase their music and video to the fans. The primary focus is on their songs,video, tour dates and locations. The value of the website is that the information is consolidated into this website.
2. Scope: The functional aspects of the website are the audio clips and video. The content of the site consists of the about page, booking page and the home page which leads them to the upcoming tours via the button.

# Technology
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap

# Demo
A live demo can be found at [here](https://ide.c9.io/chanhelmy/user-centric-assg)

# Testing
This site was tested across multiple browsers and on multiple mobile devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.

# Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The live site updates automatically each time there is a new push to the repository. You can git clone the code to run it locally on your machine.
